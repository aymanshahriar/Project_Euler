# Project_Euler

This repo contains my solutions to questions from Project Euler, which is a website containing mathematical problems intended to be solved with computer programs. 
I solved up to 11 problems, and then moved on to Hackerrank and Leetcode (which have more compsci problems and less mathematical problems).
